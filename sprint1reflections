Terminal Reflections

The command line is a text based interface for interacting with files, programes, and directories on your computer. 
It is similar to how old text based adventure games worked. Only specific commands will be understood by the computer.

I had no problems with sticking to timebox guidlines as I have previous experience with terminal / command line.

Five useful commands for the terminal are:
unix / win
ls / dir : list files and directries in current directory 
pwd / echo%cd% : present working directory (where am I now?)
cd .. : back one directory
cd dirName  : move to dirName
mkdir : create a new directory

Didn't really learn anything new here but it was a good refresher.
